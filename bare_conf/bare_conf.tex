% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex
\usepackage{lipsum}


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
\usepackage{multirow,siunitx}



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


%***CHEMISTRY PACKAGES***%
\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.c\hlinels V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan

\section{Introduction}
%no \IEEEPARstart
%\subsection{Subsection Heading Here}
%Subsection text here.
Over the past few years, HCI has been an increasing field of study. HCI can be described as a feedback loop between human and computer. With the increased usage of sensors worn on humans, such as watches, heart rate monitors, and other smart sensors, researchers are trying to extract bio-signal information and classify typical human activities. One of the ways HCI is used is for Silent Speech Interfaces (SSI). SSI aims to use signal-extracting systems like electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to convert signals of silent or non-audible speech and use a machine to classify the results. This feedback loop involves feature extraction, model training, and activity inference ~\cite{lukas_masuch_deep_nodate}.

This paper is motivated by recent work that uses machine learning and  electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect irregular heartbeats ~\cite{noauthor_classify_nodate} and electroencephalography (EEG) ~\cite{eltvik_deep_nodate} and EMG  ~\cite{altamirano_emg_nodate} to predict body movements. 

For the purpose of this research, non-audible speech can be classified as the inability to verbalize words or sentences through the use of sound in an effective way. SSI systems are not new; what is new is the computing resources and type of algorithms used to classify speech in SSI systems. In the past, machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, support vector machine, naïve nayes, and hidden markov models were used as classifiers for speech. Though powerful, they require extensive feature extraction from EMG signals. Typically, with traditional machine learning, only shallow features can be learned from those approaches, leading to undermined performance. Recently, we have witnessed the incremental development of deep learning, which alleviates the issue of feature engineering since the models extract valuable information through several iterations. Therefore, using EMG signals to classify non-verbal speech does not have to a be a laborious task.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the related work. Section III discusses the experimental setup used to capture, analyze and model the data. Section IV discusses the specific models being used in our proposed solution. Section V will discuss the proposed solutions. Section VI discusses the results from our analysis and compares them to the related work. Finally, we will conclude this paper with a discussion, future work, and conclusion.

\section{Related Work}
The research conducted using EMG to predict speech for SSI systems has been going on for over two decades. Before machine learning became very popular, using EMG to predict speech involved heavy feature extraction of the data, along with discrete mathematical modeling. There have been well documented results that have used a combination of mathematical modeling and deep learning to predict speech using EMG. Some of the research addresses syllable and single word based prediction ~\cite{lopez-larraz_syllable-based_2010}, ~\cite{maier-hein_session_2005}. Other research has addressed using EMG to predict entire phrases ~\cite{janke_emg--speech:_2017}, ~\cite{kapur_alterego:_2018}.

One of the earliest attempts to use EMG to predict speech was done in ~\cite{maier-hein_session_2005}. The goal was to predict isolated word recognition,
which was performed on a vocabulary consisting of the ten English digits \textit{0-9}. Seven electrodes were positioned on the face to extract bio-signals from the subjects. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were used as classifiers. The study was able to get an average word accuracy of 97.3\%. 

In ~\cite{wand_pattern_2014}, new approaches to  machine learning models were introduced, such as
Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithms. Their corpus consisted of 25 sessions from
20 speakers comprising of 200 read English-language utterances such as phonemes,
consonants, and vowels. In the results, the vowel features achieved accuracy scores of around 40\%. 

The work performed by ~\cite{janke_emg--speech:_2017} continued some of the primary
research done by ~\cite{wand_pattern_2014}. This research focused on using modern
deep learning techniques such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and comparing it with
GMMs. Their results showed that LSTM models performed better than that of GMM, with a
mean Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD) score of 5.46 versus 5.69, where MCD is a measure of distance, and lower numbers represent better results. 

In ~\cite{kapur_alterego:_2018}, built a proof of concept SSI system that uses
a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier. Seven electrodes
where placed around the throat and face. In their quantitative results, an average accuracy of 92.01\% for all subjects was achieved. Their corpus included individual words, and short phrases.

Finally, work done in ~\cite{noauthor_classify_nodate} uses the latest methods to classify bio-signals by converting them to scaleograms and processing them through CNN models. The research done in this paper is used to predict irregular heartbeats through ECG signals. Similar approaches for analyzing signals with a dynamical frequency spectrum, such as EMG bio-signals, can be adopted using the same method of wavelet transformations and classification. 

Our paper will attempt to research and contribute the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reproduce existing work for LSTM models used for speech recognition. 
  \item Use similar techniques of wavelet tranforms and CNN, which is presented in\cite{noauthor_classify_nodate} for ECG signals, and apply it to our EMG non-audible speech recognition models. 
\end{itemize}

\section{System Description}
The number of electrodes and bipolar channels are far greater in ~\cite{kapur_alterego:_2018}, ~\cite{wand_pattern_2014}, ~\cite{janke_emg--speech:_2017}, ~\cite{maier-hein_session_2005} than compared to our research, where we are only using three channels. This number was based on ~\cite{maier-hein_session_2005}, which stated that EMG based speech processing requires the very least signals from the cheek area and the throat. 

The system consists of two Shimmer3 EMG units, each with a 24 MHz CPU. The EMG units have the capability of recording two channels of data using \ce{Ag/AgCl} bipolar electrodes with a reference electrode connected to a bone-dense area. The bipolar electrodes are placed strategically based on work done in ~\cite{lopez-larraz_syllable-based_2010}. The areas where the EMG electrodes are placed are as follows. \textit{Depressor anguli oris} (EMG1), \textit{Zygomaticus major} (EMG2), and \textit{Anterior belly of the digastric} (EMG3). The reasoning of only choosing three EMG channels is to reduce discomfort by the user and abide by the minimum electrode placement documented by ~\cite{maier-hein_session_2005}. Each bipolar electrode of the muscle group is placed approximately 2 cm apart based on the unit specifications in (\figurename \ref{Fig. 1b}). After proper placement of the electrodes on a subject, the EMG units are placed on the subjects upper torso and shoulder, using comfort straps. The EMG units transmit data via Bluetooth to a Linux (Ubuntu) Intel laptop, which captures the EMG recordings and timestamps. The EMG units utilize open source Python to transmit data to the laptop.

\subsubsection*{Capturing Data}
After the subject is connected to the EMG units with the electrodes in place, the process of acquiring EMG data with annotated samples begins. In our experiments we are capturing two types of annotations for a our sample data. Our \textit{first set} of annotations consists of the labels for the words \textit{yes} and \textit{no}. Our \textit{second set} of annotations consists of the labels of the numeric digits \textit{0-9}. The annotations are generated at random using a python script that prints out the label for the subject to read  (\figurename \ref{Fig. 1a}). The label persists on the screen for two seconds; it is then followed by the word \textit{relax}, which persists on the screen for two more seconds. The next label in the annotations is displayed and repeated at random for a total of 50 labels per annotated set. The subject performs this task for the \textit{first set} and \textit{second set}. The associated EMG signals captured with the annotated labels will be used to train the various deep learning models which will be discussed in section \ref{Proposed Solution}. In total, 10 subjects are recruited to volunteer their data. For each set, the data will be split into 80/20 , which will be used for model training and validation respectively.

  \caption{Subjects reading rannotated labels on screen while connected to EMG units and electrodes.}
  \label{fig: conn-ann} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Cleaning Data}
Once the data is captured from the subjects, post processing of the data can begin. In order to remove the noise from the signals, filters are added after acquiring the data. We assumed that we are capturing muscle movements below 4 Hz. We also want to eliminate the 60 Hz interference from the surroundings. First, we applied a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 4 Hz. The filters are ideal and designed around a window sinc function ~\cite{noauthor_how_nodate}. After applying a low pass filter, we add a high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 Hz, which removes the aliasing and the associated DC offset. The coinciding timestamps of the EMG data with the annotations are mapped together to create an input-output relationship. \figurename \ref{fig: cleaned_signals} shows the filtered channels from the EMG with the respective annotated labels. This data will be used for the training and testing of the models. 

\begin{figure}[!t]

\end{figure}

\section{Experimental Models}
\textit{Recurrent neural networks} (RNN), in particular LSTMs, are an effective tool for sequence processing that learn hidden representations of their sequential input. An LSTM can use its memory cells to remember long-range information and keep track of various attributes of data it is currently processing ~\cite{karpathy_visualizing_2016}. An LSTM, is built from an RNN, which works by unrolling data into N different copies of itself. Input of data from previous time steps $t_{n-1}$, $t_{n-2}$, $t_{n-3}$ \ldots, $t_{0}$ can be used when the current time-step $t_{n}$ is being evaluated. RNNs can learn temporal dependencies in the sequential data, and use it to classify new data. These unique capablities make RNNs and LSTMs ideal for classification of time-series data such as EMG signals. Adding multiple layers to LSTMs can improve results to experiments reltated to speech recognition, as investigated by ~\cite{graves_speech_2013}. In our experiment, we will use the sequential data from each EMG channel to classify the annotated labels in our data sets.

Another deep learning model that we investigated, are \textit{Convolutional Neural Networks}. CNNs are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives an input and performs a series of matrix operations in order to predict classification scores ~\cite{noauthor_cs231n_nodate}. CNN architectures make the assumption that the inputs are images, which allow to encode values as matrices and perform dot product operations. In order to convert sequential time-series data into image representations, we investigated \textit{Wavelet Transforms}, specifically Continuous Wavelet Transforms (CWT).

Unlike fourier transform approaches that only show a signal representation in the frequency domain, wavelet transforms show both time and frequency representations. The wavelet transform of a one-dimensinal signal will have two dimensions. This two-dimentional output is the time-scale image representaion of the signal in the form of a scaleogram. This scaleogram gives information about the dynamic behaviour of the system, similar to that of a distinguishable image. Thefore, the wavelet transform represents a suitable method for the classification of EMG signals ~\cite{pauk_419._2008} by using CNN models, which can automatically detect the class each scaleogram belongs to and classify them accordingly.

\section{Proposed Solution} \label{Proposed Solution}
Once the data is filtered and transformed it will be ready for modeling. We used the two second window samples of when the subject repeated an annotated label on the screen, and dropped the instances where the word \textit{relax} existed. In our first experiment, we created a LSTM model. The LSTM model is comprised of a Sigmoid activation with a learning rate of \textit{1e-4}. To measure the loss of the model, we used binary cross-entropy for the binary cases of \textit{yes} and \textit{no}, and categorical cross-entropy for the cases \textit{0-9}. The LSTM model consisted of a single LSTM layer followed by a Dense output layer. 

For our second experiment, we used the method of CNN as a deep learning model. We converted our singals into wavelet transforms, which generated scalograms that show resolution in the frequency and time-domains ~\cite{admin_guide_2018}. Since there are three EMG channels of data, we created three sclaeograms per annotated label.  We then placed the three scaleograms on top of each other, per annotated label, and created an image representation. The coefficients from the output of the scaleogram is then utilized as features to train the CNN model. All of the models were trained on a Google Cloud Compute Engine with four virtual CPUs, 26 GB memory, and one NVIDIA Tesla K80 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

To evaluate the performance of the models for deep learning, we used precision and recall as identifying factors. In the experiments, recall is the fraction that the model actually predicted correct. Precision is the fraction of the model making a correct positive class classification. 
Table 1 shows the precision and recall for the LSTM model in our binary classification case.  After 10 epochs of the model, the precision and recall scores for the test data are higher when compared to the training set. The continuous wavelet transform with CNN approach was also trained for 10 epochs.  Currently for the CWT-CNN model, precision and recall scores are harder to evaluate due to the large size of the dataset. 
In comparison with  ~\cite{kapur_alterego:_2018}, ~\cite{janke_emg--speech:_2017}, who used similar deep learning models in their research, had better accuracy results when compared to our work. A major contributing factor to their increase performance is the abundance of data. In ~\cite{kapur_alterego:_2018}, over 30 hours of training data was captured in order to train the model

\section{Conclusion}
% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
